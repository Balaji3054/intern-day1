1. Introduction to the Team & Company
Meet the Team: You'll be introduced to the developers, your mentor, and possibly other interns. You'll also get familiar with the communication channels (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.).
Overview of the Company/Project: Your mentor or manager will give you an overview of the company’s goals, ongoing projects, and how the MERN stack fits into the development process.
2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Installing Necessary Tools: You’ll likely need to set up some tools like:
VS Code or another code editor.
Node.js and npm for managing packages.
MongoDB (or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).
Git for version control.
Cloning the Repository: You’ll be asked to clone the main repository from GitHub to your local machine so you can start contributing to the codebase.
